# Bhāṣācitra

Bhāṣācitra (lit. "language map" in Sanskrit) is a database of linguistic resources on South Asian languages. Drawing from location data compiled from the sources, we map language distributions across the Subcontinent. It is a new kind of bibliography, meant to centralise and ease access to useful linguistic work on all languages of the region.

We analyse language coverage and look towards applications to typology by visualising example datasets. The application is not only meant to be useful for feature mapping, but also serves as a new kind of interactive bibliography for linguists of South Asian languages.",
