# Bhāṣācitra

Bhāṣācitra (lit. "language map" in Sanskrit) is a database of linguistic resources on South Asian languages. Drawing from location data compiled from the sources, we map language distributions across the Subcontinent. It is a new kind of bibliography, meant to centralise and ease access to useful linguistic work on all languages of the region.
